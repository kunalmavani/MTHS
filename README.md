These python codes are part of the Modelling of Thermo- and Hydrodynamic systems lecture. 

There are two subdirectories  
- higherOrder: this lecture discussed higher-order finite differnce methods applied to the linear advection equation. You can donwload the python source within the directory or view it here [CLICK HERE TO SEE THE CODE](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Fluid-Dynamics-Of-Energy-Systems-Team/MTHS/blob/master/higherOrder/higherOrder.ipynb)
- turbulenceModeling: shows the implementation of a k-epsilon turbulence model to solve a full developed turbulent flow in a channel. You can donwload the python source within the directory or view it here [CLICK HERE TO SEE THE CODE](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Fluid-Dynamics-Of-Energy-Systems-Team/MTHS/blob/master/turbulenceModeling/main_complete.ipynb)
